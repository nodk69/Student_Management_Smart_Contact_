## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Add Students**: Add new students with their ID, name, and grade.
- **Update Students**: Modify a student's name and grade by their ID.
- **Update Grades**: Update only the grade of a student by their ID.
- **Delete Students**: Remove a student from the records by their ID.
- **Retrieve Student Information**: Fetch a student's details by their ID.

## ðŸ“œ Smart Contract Overview

### Contract: `StudentContact`

#### Struct: `Student`
- `uint id`: Unique identifier for the student.
- `string name`: Name of the student.
- `uint grade`: Grade of the student.

#### Key Functions:
1. **`addStudent(uint _id, string memory _name, uint _grade)`**
   - Adds a new student to the contract.

2. **`updateStudentById(uint _id, string memory _name, uint _grade)`**
   - Updates a student's name and grade by their ID.

3. **`updateStudentGrade(uint _id, uint _newGrade)`**
   - Updates only the grade of a student by their ID.

4. **`getInformationById(uint _id)`**
   - Retrieves a student's details by their ID.

5. **`deleteById(uint _id)`**
   - Deletes a student by their ID.

6. **`getAllStudentInformation()`**
   - Retrieves details of all students in the contract.

7. **`bulkAddStudents(Student[] memory newStudents)`**
   - Adds multiple students to the contract at once.

8. **`clearAllStudents()`**
   - Deletes all student records from the contract.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Solidity Compiler**: Install the Solidity compiler (`solc`).
- **Ethereum Development Environment**: Use tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).

### Deployment
1. Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.
2. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., local development network, testnet, or mainnet).
3. Interact with the contract using a web3 library or a tool like Remix.

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Adding a Student
```solidity
addStudent(1, "Alice", 90);
```

### Updating Student Information
```solidity
updateStudentById(1, "Alice Smith", 95);
```

### Updating Student Grade
```solidity
updateStudentGrade(1, 97);
```

### Deleting a Student
```solidity
deleteById(1);
```

### Retrieving Student Information
```solidity
Student memory student = getInformationById(1);
```

### Bulk Operations
```solidity
Student[] memory newStudents = new Student[](2);
newStudents[0] = Student(2, "Bob", 85);
newStudents[1] = Student(3, "Charlie", 88);
bulkAddStudents(newStudents);
```

### Clearing All Students
```solidity
clearAllStudents();
```

### Retrieving All Students
```solidity
Student[] memory allStudents = getAllStudentInformation();
```
